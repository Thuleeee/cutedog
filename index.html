            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                My father brought a puppy home when I was very young, and it grew up with me.
                For me, it is not only a guard dog but also a very close friend. I have taught it many things—it knows
                how to stand and sit when I signal with my hand. My dog is very smart and agile.
            </p>
            <p>
                It plays with me whenever my parents are away. Having it by my side makes me never feel lonely.
                We share the same schedule: eating together, sleeping together, and doing almost everything side by side.
                When I fall down, it helps me stand up. It’s also quite funny—it eats a lot and refuses dog food!
                My father even cooks for it as part of the family.
            </p>
            <p>
                It patiently listens whenever I confide and wags its tail happily when I come home. It gets sad
                whenever I go away and sometimes even refuses to eat. Now that I’m studying abroad, I miss it deeply.
                This page is for it—so whenever I miss my dog, I can open this and remember all the wonderful times we shared.
